# Updates

## 2026-02-09 (Re-Registration Support After Cancellation)
- **Users can re-register for events after cancelling without encountering duplicate registration errors**
- System reuses cancelled registration record instead of creating new one
- Previous registration data can be retrieved for pre-filling forms
- Email confirmation sent on re-registration

**Changes:**
- [registration.controller.ts](src/controllers/registration.controller.ts)
  - Added `getPreviousRegistration()` endpoint to fetch last registration (including cancelled)
  - Modified `registerForEvent()` to handle re-registration after cancellation
  - Moved profile validation before registration check for better flow
  - If existing registration status is 'cancelled': UPDATE record with new data
  - If existing registration status is 'registered' or 'attended': throw error
  - If no existing registration: INSERT new record
  - Maintains unique constraint (event_id, user_id) without conflicts

- [registration.routes.ts](src/routes/registration.routes.ts)
  - Added GET `/api/registrations/previous/:eventId` endpoint
  - Requires authentication
  - Returns most recent registration for user+event combination

**Backend Logic Flow:**
```
1. Validate event exists and has capacity
2. Check profile completion (moved before registration check)
3. Check existing registration for event_id + user_id
4. If exists with status 'cancelled':
   - UPDATE registration_data, status='registered', registered_at=NOW()
   - Send email confirmation
   - Return updated record
5. If exists with status 'registered' or 'attended':
   - Throw "Already registered" error
6. If not exists:
   - INSERT new registration
   - Send email confirmation
   - Return new record
```

**Database:**
- Registration status enum: 'registered' | 'attended' | 'cancelled'
- Unique constraint on (event_id, user_id) still enforced
- No schema changes required
- registration_data stored as jsonb (includes form fields and file URLs)

**API Endpoints:**
- POST `/api/registrations` - Create or update registration
  - If cancelled registration exists: updates it
  - If no registration exists: creates new one
  - If active registration exists: returns error

- GET `/api/registrations/previous/:eventId` - Get previous registration
  - Returns most recent registration for current user + event
  - Includes cancelled registrations
  - Returns null if no previous registration

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminates duplicate registration errors on re-registration
- ✅ Preserves registration history in database
- ✅ Enables pre-filling forms with previous data
- ✅ Maintains data integrity with unique constraint
- ✅ No database migration required
- ✅ Email confirmation on re-registration

**Security:**
- Profile validation still enforced before registration
- User can only access their own registration data
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Rate limiting applied to registration endpoint

## 2026-02-09 (Client-Side Image Upload with Cloudinary Signature)
- **Migrated from server-side to client-side image uploads for better performance**
- Backend generates secure signature, frontend uploads directly to Cloudinary
- Eliminates backend as proxy, reducing serverless execution time
- Improves upload speed and reduces bandwidth costs

**Changes:**
- [upload.controller.ts](src/controllers/upload.controller.ts)
  - Added `getUploadSignature()` endpoint to generate Cloudinary upload signature
  - Returns timestamp, signature, api_key, folder, and transformation settings
  - Uses CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET to sign upload parameters
  - Supports different folders: avatars, event-images, payment-proofs
  - Includes transformation settings (max dimensions, quality, format)

- [upload.routes.ts](src/routes/upload.routes.ts)
  - Added GET `/api/upload/signature` endpoint
  - Requires authentication via basicAuth middleware
  - Returns signature data for secure client-side upload

**Architecture Change:**
```
Before (Server-Side Upload):
Client → Backend (multer) → Cloudinary → Backend → Client
- File passes through backend
- Uses serverless function execution time
- Doubles bandwidth usage

After (Client-Side Upload):
Client → Backend (signature only) → Client → Cloudinary
- File goes directly to Cloudinary
- Backend only generates signature (~10ms)
- Minimal serverless execution
- Single bandwidth usage
```

**Security:**
- Signature generated server-side with API secret
- Timestamp prevents replay attacks
- Folder restrictions enforced
- Transformation limits prevent abuse
- Same security as server-side upload

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Performance**: Direct upload is faster than proxy
- ✅ **Cost**: Reduces serverless execution time significantly
- ✅ **Bandwidth**: Backend doesn't handle file transfer
- ✅ **Scalability**: Cloudinary handles upload load
- ✅ **Reliability**: One less hop in the chain
- ✅ **UX**: Better progress feedback possible

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1675872000,
  "signature": "abc123...",
  "api_key": "123456789",
  "folder": "ngevent/avatars",
  "transformation": "w_500,h_500,c_limit,q_auto,f_auto"
}
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Old `POST /api/upload` endpoint still available
- Supports gradual migration
- Can be removed in future version

## 2026-02-09 (Auto-delete Old Avatar from Cloudinary on Profile Update)
- **Added automatic cleanup of old avatar images when user updates profile picture**
- Prevents orphaned files in Cloudinary storage
- Only deletes Cloudinary-hosted images (not Google OAuth avatars)

**Changes:**
- [profile.controller.ts](src/controllers/profile.controller.ts)
  - Added `getPublicIdFromUrl()` helper to extract public_id from Cloudinary URL
  - Added `deleteCloudinaryImage()` helper to delete image from Cloudinary
  - Modified `updateProfile()` to delete old avatar before saving new one
  - Checks if old avatar exists and is different from new one
  - Only deletes if URL contains 'cloudinary.com' (not Google avatars)
  - Configured Cloudinary client with credentials

**Flow:**
1. User updates profile with new avatar_url
2. Backend fetches current profile to get old avatar_url
3. If old avatar exists and is Cloudinary URL:
   - Extract public_id from URL
   - Delete from Cloudinary using `cloudinary.uploader.destroy()`
4. Save new avatar_url to database
5. Old file removed from Cloudinary storage

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents storage waste from orphaned files
- ✅ Reduces Cloudinary storage costs
- ✅ Keeps storage clean and organized
- ✅ Safe: Only deletes Cloudinary images, not Google OAuth avatars
- ✅ Non-blocking: Delete errors don't prevent profile update
- ✅ Automatic: No manual cleanup needed

**Public ID Extraction:**
- Handles standard Cloudinary URL format
- Supports versioned URLs (v1234567890/...)
- Extracts from path after /upload/
- Removes file extension

**Safety:**
- Only deletes if old avatar is Cloudinary URL
- Doesn't delete if same URL (no change)
- Errors logged but don't block update
- Google OAuth avatars are preserved

## 2026-02-09 (Complete Reset Password Feature)

  - Added `resetPasswordSchema` - validates token and newPassword (min 8 chars)
  - Exported schemas for use in routes

- [auth.routes.ts](src/routes/auth.routes.ts)
  - Applied `validateSchema(schemas.forgotPassword)` middleware to /forgot-password
  - Applied `validateSchema(schemas.resetPassword)` middleware to /reset-password
  - Both endpoints now have proper input validation

- [.env.example](.env.example)
  - Added `FRONTEND_URL` variable for email link generation
  - Defaults to http://localhost:5173 if not set
  - Used by sendPasswordResetEmail to generate reset links

**Existing Functionality (Already Working):**
- ✅ Schema has resetPasswordToken and resetPasswordExpires fields
- ✅ forgotPassword controller generates token and sends email
- ✅ resetPassword controller validates token and updates password
- ✅ Email template for password reset exists
- ✅ Token expires after 1 hour
- ✅ Security: doesn't reveal if email exists

**Reset Password Flow:**
1. User requests reset at /api/auth/forgot-password with email
2. Backend generates token, saves to DB with 1-hour expiry
3. Email sent with reset link: {FRONTEND_URL}/reset-password?token=xxx
4. User clicks link, enters new password
5. Frontend POSTs to /api/auth/reset-password with token + newPassword
6. Backend validates token, updates password, clears token

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Proper input validation on both endpoints
- ✅ Clear error messages for validation failures
- ✅ Secure token-based password reset
- ✅ Configurable frontend URL for deployment
- ✅ Email doesn't reveal if account exists (security)

## 2026-02-09 (Add UUID Field to Events Table)

- Events now have both readable short ID (6 chars) and UUID for robust identification
- UUID is automatically generated and guaranteed unique

**Schema Changes:**
- [schema.ts](src/db/schema.ts)
  - Added `uuid` column to events table
  - UUID is auto-generated with `defaultRandom()`
  - UUID is NOT NULL and UNIQUE
  - Existing `id` field remains as primary key for human-readable references

**Migration:**
- [0005_violet_hardball.sql](drizzle/0005_violet_hardball.sql)
  - Adds `uuid` column with `gen_random_uuid()` default
  - Adds unique constraint on `uuid`
  - Existing events get UUID automatically

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Globally unique identifier for events
- ✅ Maintains existing short ID for user-friendly URLs
- ✅ Better for external integrations and APIs
- ✅ Prevents ID conflicts across different systems
- ✅ Standard UUID format for better compatibility

**Use Cases:**
- API integrations can use UUID for reliable references

- **Changed event ID from UUID to 6-character alphanumeric string**
- **Updated URL slug from `/events/:id` to `/e/:id`** for shorter, shareable links
- Generated IDs use safe characters (excludes similar looking: 0, O, 1, I, L)
- Example: `/e/3K7M2P` instead of `/events/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`
- All frontend routes updated to use new `/e/:id` pattern
- Edit route: `/e/:id/edit` (was `/events/:id/edit`)

**Benefits:**

# Apply migration
bun run db:migrate
```

⚠️ **Important**: This is a breaking change. See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details.
- Best for fresh database installations
- Existing UUID data cannot be auto-converted to 6-char IDs
- Production requires careful planning and backup

**ID Format:**
- Length: 6 characters
- Character set: 23456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ (30 chars)
- Excludes: 0, O, 1, I, L (to avoid confusion)

  - Automatic skip rate limiting for localhost IPs (127.0.0.1, ::1, ::ffff:127.0.0.1)
- Better developer experience when testing authentication flows
- Production limits remain reasonable for security

**Changes:**
- [rateLimiter.ts](src/middlewares/rateLimiter.ts) - Enhanced with development detection and localhost whitelist

**Rate Limits:**

| Endpoint Type | Production | Development |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Auth (/api/auth/*) | 20 req/15min | 200 req/15min (or unlimited for localhost) |
| General API | 100 req/15min | 1000 req/15min (or unlimited for localhost) |

## 2026-01-28 (v4 - Wajib Lengkapi Profil untuk Registrasi)
- **Validasi profil lengkap sebelum registrasi event**: User wajib melengkapi semua field profil sebelum bisa mendaftar event
- Field wajib: `full_name`, `phone`, `institution`, `position`, `city`
- API `POST /api/registrations` mengembalikan `403` dengan pesan spesifik field mana yang belum dilengkapi
- Semua endpoint auth (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/google/login`, `/api/auth/me`) sekarang mengembalikan semua field profil

## 2026-01-27 (v3 - Cache Control untuk Profile)
- **Menambahkan Cache-Control headers untuk endpoint profile**
- Middleware cache di `index.ts` untuk GET requests ke `/api/profile`:
  - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=600`
  - Cache 5 menit dengan stale-while-revalidate 10 menit
  - Membantu browser cache response yang berisi `avatar_url` dari Google
- Response profile sekarang bisa di-cache oleh browser
- Mengurangi load ke database untuk data yang jarang berubah

## 2026-01-27 (v2 - Client-side flow)
- **Changed Google OAuth flow to client-side**: Frontend now handles Google login and sends credential to backend for verification.
- Added endpoint `POST /api/auth/google/login` that accepts Google credential token from frontend.
- Removed old server-side OAuth endpoints (`GET /api/auth/google` and `GET /api/auth/google/callback`).
- Simplified backend: now only requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (no need for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, or `FRONTEND_URL`).

### Benefits
- No popup/redirect complexity
- Simpler state management (no CSRF cookies needed)
- Better UX with Google One Tap
- Easier debugging

### Env vars (backend)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (required - same ID used by frontend)
